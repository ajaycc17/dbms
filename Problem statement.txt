Here you need to write a python program that can
      (a) Do data definition operations (Create, Drop and Modify schemas/tables)
      (b) Do data manipulation operations (Insert, Update, Select, )
      (c) Add integrity constraints (Declare 'NotNull', Primary keys, Foreign keys). It should show errors if an integrity constraint can not be added. 
      (d) Add/remove users and their privileges. It should show errors in case a privilege can not be given or removed. 
     
Note: Everything is to be done on the python console. I shouldn't need to write anything on the MySQL console to do the task.
